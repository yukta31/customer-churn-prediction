# Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict customer churn based on behavioral and demographic features.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: `customer_churn.csv`
- Contains attributes like gender, contract type, tenure, monthly charges, etc.
- Target variable: `Churn` (Yes/No)

## 🔍 Objective
To build and evaluate a classification model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)

## 📈 Model Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature encoding and scaling
4. Model training and evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
5. Visualization of model performance

## 📂 Files Included
- `churn.ipynb`: Full code with data preprocessing, visualization, and ML modeling
- `customer_churn.csv`: Dataset used in the notebook

## 📌 How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
